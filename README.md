# TLNBm-NCP
# Project Title

This project was used to train a neural network model for predicting vehicle steering angles.




## Introduce

The project consists of three main parts:

1. modeling part: defines the neural network model for predicting the steering angle of the vehicle.
2. Data Processing Section: Used to process the input data including images and steering angles.
3. Training section: used to train the neural network model and evaluate its performance.

## File structure

- `TLNBm-NCP.py`: contains definitions of neural network models, including steering angle prediction models.
- `data.py`: contains data processing functions and custom dataset classes for loading and processing input data.
- `train.py`: contains the code for training the neural network model, including optimizer configuration and implementation of the training loop.
- `README.md`: The description file, which provides an overview of the project, its structure and usage.
## Usage

1. Install required dependencies: Make sure you have installed all the dependencies required by the project, which can be installed using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Configure parameters: Configure the hyperparameters and training parameters of the model in your code according to your needs.

3. Run training: Run the training.py file to start training the model. You can specify the data path, model parameters, etc. via command line arguments.
python train.py --data_path /path/to/data --num_epochs 10
4. Evaluate the model: After training, you can use the test data to evaluate the performance of the model and view its prediction results.
##Precaution
This project only provides basic example code that you may need to modify and extend for your own needs.
If you use pre-trained models or other resources, please make sure to follow their licenses and terms of use.
